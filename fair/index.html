            So you would like to take programming electives! Still on the fence? Do you have 
            questions to ask? Join us at the
            Programming Course Fair 2024 and connect with teachers as well as current students.
            During the fair you can attend one or more sessions where teachers tell 
            about their programs and courses. There will also be plenty of opportunity
            to ask questions.
