This course is useful to most students taking ML1 and ML2, as it covers more advanced Python topics that are needed for ML programming, but are not part of most introductory Python courses. Topics include: designing larger programs, writing more efficient code, using the Numpy and Pandas libraries to write vectorized code, and working with object-oriented code by writing your own classes. This course is for the programming assignments of both ML1 and ML2, but can be started simultaneously with ML1.
