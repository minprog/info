# Scientific Programming (EN)

This program is provided in English to all students and staff of the University of Amsterdam. The first parts will be offered from September 2019, and the final part will be offered from February 2020 onwards.

Scientific Programming is a 12-credit course that aims to teach you to program in Python with special attention to scientific applications. We assume no programming experience and our primary goal is to help you program well.

Note that this course is not part of and cannot be combined with the Programming Minor.

- **Workload**: 10â€“20 hours a week, depending on your personal goals
- **Materials**: all courses only have online materials
- **Attendance**: 2-4 hours a week maximum --- other help is **only online**


## 1. Scientific programming

We'll introduce you to Python using a selection of scientific applications, from the fields of physics, biology, artificial intelligence, sociology and more. Current modules include:

- Number theory
- Text processing and analysis
- Numeric integration
- Population dynamics
- Monopoly game simulation
- Climate data analysis

Scientific Programming 2 focuses on teaching you "the rest of Python" so you will be ready to read other scientists' code and contribute to open source projects. Do have a look at <https://sp1.mprog.nl/modules> and <https://sp2.mprog.nl/modules> to see what these courses are all about!

## 2. Data processing

Building on your experience with solving problems in Python, you'll learn about working with larger or unstructured datasets and gain insights by summarizing, filtering and modeling. We'll help you master the basic techniques and then you will devise your own project, taking a dataset of your choosing, formulate a scientific question and try to answer it using computational techniques.

## Prerequisites

Generally speaking, there are no prerequisites to start at Scientific Programming 1. If you have taken a 3 credit course on Python programming in a scientific setting, you can possibly skip the first course. If you have already taken courses in R or Python before, this series may not be for you after all. Let us know which course you took and in which programme, and we may be able to help you decide. Other than that, note that the courses need to be taken in the order specified above!
