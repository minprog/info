# Scientific Programming (EN)

This program is offered in English to students and staff of the University of Amsterdam. It will be offered from February 2020 onwards.

Scientific Programming is a 12-credit course that aims to teach you to program in Python for scientific applications. We assume no programming experience and our primary goal is to help you program *well*.

- **Workload**: about 20â€“25 hours a week
- **Materials**: all courses have online materials augmented with in-lab sessions and lectures
- **Attendance**: 4-8 hours a week

## 1. Scientific programming

We'll introduce you to Python using a selection of scientific applications, from the fields of physics, biology, artificial intelligence, sociology and more.

## 2. Data processing

Building on your experience with solving problems in Python, you'll learn about working with larger or unstructured datasets and gain insights by summarizing, filtering and modeling.

## Prerequisites

Generally speaking, there are no prerequisites to start this track. If you have taken a 3 credit course on Python programming in a scientific setting, you can possibly skip the first course. If you have already taken courses in R or Python before, this series may not be for you. Let us know which course you took and in which programme, and we may be able to help you decide. Other than that, note that the courses need to be taken in the order specified above!


## Application

To enroll, use the following course codes in SIS:

- 50621PRP6Y Scientific Programming 1, 3 credits
- 50622PRP6Y Scientific Programming 2, 3 credits
- 5062DAPR6Y Data Processing, 6 credits

To enroll as UvA staff, please refer to <https://datanose.nl/#contract> and use the same course codes. You can choose to have the university to pay your course fees (this is offered by the university and the fee is not taken from your own department's budget).
