## Prerequisites

Generally speaking, there are no prerequisites to start this track. If you have taken a 3 credit course on Python programming in a scientific setting, you can possibly skip the first course. Let us know which course you took and in which programme, and we'll check it out. Other than that, note that the courses need to be taken in the order specified above!


## Application

To enroll as a current student, use the following course codes in SIS:

- 50621PRP6Y Scientific Programming 1, 3 credits
- 50622PRP6Y Scientific Programming 2, 3 credits
