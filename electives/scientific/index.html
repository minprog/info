        What is Scientific Programming about?
    </h2>
    <p class="display-6">
        Scientists use computation to simulate real-world scenarios, to mine data obtained in
        large-scale studies, and to gain insights that might otherwise stay hidden. A bit of 
        programming knowledge and a couple of 
        basic techniques are all that you need to get better and faster results. Our courses below
        help you learn Python, a language now often used in science, as well as many techniques
        that you can use in your own projects. Whether you're a student or a seasoned researcher,
        you're welcome to learn with us!

        How we teach
    </h3>
    <p class="display-6">
        The courses are self-contained and allow you to progress
        by studying programming theory and... writing many programs!
        All problems are small versions of real scientific computing challenges. Later, you'll
        progress towards defining, designing and implementing larger projects.
        When registered, you get access to the tutorials where we are available to 
        help you. And you will get access to an online a forum where students may post
        questions and answers.

        Taking for credits
    </h3>
    <p class="display-6">
        Our courses are available to take online for free by following the links to the course websites, below.
        If you would like to have access to tutoring opportunities or take the courses for credit,
        you may officially register as a student as 
        described below. If you register and then hand in all assignments and take the relevant exams,
        you can earn course credit (ects). If you'd like to use this credit as part of your diploma,
        please ask your program's study adviser for help in transferring credits.

            You can earn a certificate or course credit by 
            registering one or more of the courses. Enrolling officially also connects you to the community 
             of students and teachers for our courses. Generally, you can plan to do any of our
             courses between September–December (must finish by December 15th) and 
             February–May (must finish by May 15th).

                Are you a regular UvA bachelor's or master's student? You can self-register through 
                <a href="http://glass.uva.nl">GLASS</a>.
                You can do this even after courses start. Make sure to register for the 
                right semester! Registration for the next semester starts during the 
                usual course registration periods.

                Are you a UvA employee, including PhD students? In many cases the university 
                will pay for your course registration. Do keep in mind the workload. If you'd
                like to register, or if you have questions, please
                <a href="mailto:scientific@proglab.nl">send an e-mail</a> so we can help you out!

                Are you a Dutch student registered for a bachelor's programme at a Dutch

                student at the UvA (choose Informatiekunde as your bachelor),

                cannot register as an "electives" student because Scientific Programming
                are bachelor's
                level courses. You might consider registering by paying course fees directly,
