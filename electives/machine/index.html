        What are these courses about?
    </h2>
    <p class="display-6">

        Our core courses are Introduction to <strong>Machine Learning 1 and 2</strong>. These
        courses are intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to the current field of
        machine learning. Both courses are built around programming and experimentation as the
        primary means of understanding machine learning algorithms. You will progress from
        implementing basic learning algorithms to creating more advanced neural networks. In
        addition, you will dive into the math behind these algorithms, and we will discuss the
        societal impact of applying such methods in practice.

    </p>
    
    <p class="display-6">

        To complement the Machine Learning courses, you will need to at least take
        <strong>Scientific Programming 2</strong> as well. This course covers some more advanced
        Python topics that are not part of most introductory Python courses, like: designing larger
        programs, writing more efficient code, using the Numpy and Pandas libraries to write
        vectorized code, and designing your own classes. If your do not yet have a good grasp of
        writing Python code from scratch, you should take more of our programming courses, as
        described below.

    </p>
    
    <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">
        How we teach
    </h3>
    <p class="display-6">

        The machine learning courses consist of programming notebooks, theory videos, and written
        assignments. Programming notebooks will be the main component of each module, where you'll
        build and experiment with the ML algorithm covered that week. The office hours for the
        courses mainly consist of laptop practicals in our lab, where you can come and ask any
        questions you have about the theory or specifics of the programming assignments. Machine
        Learning 1 and 2 conclude with a written final exam. Programming
        courses generally have code-writing exams.

    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">
        Prerequisites
    </h3>
    <p class="display-6">

        These courses are primarily aimed at students who have already taken Python programming
        courses, as well as good introductions to Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. Note
        that none of these courses are hard entry requirements, but you should expect to spend more
        time if you still need to study some of these topics on your own. For the maths topics we
        provide self-study modules, and there are several programming courses that you can take in
        parallel, as listed below.

    </p>
    
    <p class="display-6">
        
        If you intend to follow ML1 and ML2 without prior Python programming experience, or you
        still feel a bit uncomfortable programming, we would recommend that you register for the <a
        href="/programs/minai">minor AI</a> instead. The minor will cover most of the same material
        as our electives, but we can offer more support and supervision for students learning both
        programming and machine learning at the same time. However, it does require full-time
        attendance and it's Dutch-only.

    </p>

        What it is not
    </h3>
    <p class="display-6">
    
        The elective courses below do not add up to 30EC, and cannot be considered an official
        minor program. But you may be able to combine them with other courses as electives in your
        bachelor. Ask your 
        study adviser to help you get permission to put them on your diploma.
        Also realise that our courses cannot be used as part of the entry requirement 
        to the Master AI at the UvA. See the
        <a href="https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/artificial-intelligence/application-and-admission/dutch-prior-education/dutch-prior-education-foldout-menu.html#2-Check-entry-requirements">

        Below are the courses offered as Machine Learning electives. In most circumstances 
        you will not need permission from your own program to take any of these courses; however, if
        you would like to use the courses for your diploma, please contact your own program's
        study adviser to plan ahead.

                Are you a regular UvA bachelor's or master's student? You can self-register through 
                <a href="http://glass.uva.nl">GLASS</a>.
                You can do this even after courses start. Make sure to register for the 
                right semester! Registration for the next semester starts during the 
                usual course registration periods.

                Are you a UvA employee, including PhD students? In many cases the university 
                will pay for your course registration. Do keep in mind the workload. If you'd
                like to register, or if you have questions, please

                Are you a student at a Dutch master's programme? In that case you
                cannot register as an "electives" student because these
                are bachelor's
                level courses. You might consider registering by paying course fees directly, 
                so check the next option for that.
